== HTTP Status Codes
Index-service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
  | Status | Description

  | `200 OK`
  | Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

  | `201 Created`
  | The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.

  | `204 No Content`
  | The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.

  | `400 Bad Request`
  | The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

  | `404 Not Found`
  | The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
